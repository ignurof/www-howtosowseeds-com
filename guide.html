                    This is THE informational guide on how to sow sunflower seeds to prepare for the gardening season ahead or maybe you're just experimenting and want to try to grow sunflowers inside all year round.

                First you have to make sure you have all the things you need to make things happen in the garden and start sowing seeds the right way! You will needs empty pots to put the soil and seeds in. You will need some soil, preferably sowing soil that has been perfected for optimal sowing conditions, but honestly, most soil will work but some plants are more sensitive to the amount of nutrients that are usually available in the non-sowing kinds of soil.<br>This is why we always recommend sowing with a sowing soil, as it will have the correct nutrient balance for baby seedlings and also perfect aeration and general soil qualities.<br><br>Also, make sure you have access to good ol' fashioned water, but this water has to be of good quality, preferably drinkable tap water or rain water if you live in a appropriate region.

                <p>
                    After you have sown your seeds in the soil, covered them lightly with some of that fresh sowing soil then its time to make sure the pots and future seedlings have everything they need so you need to give all the pots a good proper watering so they are soaked and stay moist for the rest of the sowing period. It is very important that the relative humidity around your sowing area is very high as sowing seeds require the enviroment to be moist, and once those seedlings pop the soil they like it to be moist for the first couple of hours prerferably.
