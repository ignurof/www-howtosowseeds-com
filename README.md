## User Experience

Great deal of thinking went into why the website should be structured the way it is and look the way it does.
I wanted it to convey information in a quick and easy manner to the user so that everything is clear and structured in a very readable way.
Taking inspiration from established web practices and how to layout a website and structure the content to best pull in the user and help them navigate the site through web familiarity.

### Interaction Experience

I made sure that all interactables on the website had a feel to them in the form of special styling rules being applies while the user is either hovering over or pressing links or important call-to-action buttons.
To keep things in line with that users expect from a website, the logo is always a link that leads back to the home page, but this one is unaffected by the interaction design experience as that seems to be the standard from the research.

## Testing 

Manual testing with Firefox through development process.
During the whole development process as can be found through the git commit history, I have been painstakingly manually testing every single change and completed set of features by hand through the means of navigating around the site and it's features as a normal user would, testing out the responsiveness and how the content and/or features look by making use of the Firefox dev tools to change the viewport size.
Every button has been pressed and investigated more than hundres of times through the process, the same with any link, paragraph or image content.
The website has also been combed through with the use of a android phone to make sure that the mobile-first design has always been grounded in the real world!
After completed development cycle I have also gone through the whole site one last time to make sure I did not miss anything, and through the whole development process I have taken notes and crossed of those notes whenever I noticed there was a task that needed to be taken care of, for example seeing something not being perfectly responsive during testing I would note that down, keep testing and then return to address whatever the issue was when development was resumed.
