howtosowseeds.com is an informational guide site to help people around the world with general information and guides on how to sow different kinds of seeds.
The intention is to bring more people into the gardening hobby and the main target demographic of the site is beginners to gardening and anything related to seed sowing. 
howtosowseeds.com will be a good place of reference for gardeners to know just when and how to sow their seeds even when they're not beginners anymore.

## Features 
The site features are very simple in nature since the focus of the site is on the informational guide content in both text, image and video format.
Starting out with the layout of the site it should feature a main header at the top of the site that contains the logo and navigational menu,
a hero background image that covers the main content section of the page with some motivational gardening text over it that has a clear and positive call-to-action button to take the user to the guides roughly and then naturally there will be a footer at the bottom of the page.
